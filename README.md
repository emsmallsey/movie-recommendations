# PROJECT 1 - TV Show Recommendations

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
A simple application that uses the TMDB API to recommend similar TV shows to a user based on the title of the show they last watched. 

## TECHNOLOGIES
* Jquery
* AJAX and Javascript
* TMDB API
* Bootstrap 

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
* Implement responsive design
* Have one or more complex user interface modules
* Make an external data source request

## APPROACH USED
I developed the basic logic first, leaving the complex design logic to last. 

## CHALLENGES FACED
* Planning - I did not spend enough time planning how the complex design feature would affect the basic logic, and therefore spent a lot of time trying to make carousels work, leaving not a lot of time to spend on other additional features. 
* Carousels - spent a lot of time mucking around with multi card carousels and then dynamically changing slides in a carousel. Hate them now. 

## FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
* Add localstorage() to the watch next list
* make the watch next list into a multi carousel
* link the watch next list/the similar results list to a utelly API call to show what streaming services it is available on
